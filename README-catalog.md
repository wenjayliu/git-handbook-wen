## Introduction

GitHub doesn't provide a `[[toc]]` like function to generate toc(Table of contents) for markdown file. But sometimes an outline of a long readme file or other markdown page is very helpful. That's why does the simple **ghtoc** come.

**ghtoc** was written and tested with `python 2.7.8`

## Features & Limitation

- auto backup the input file before toc was generated and inserted
- currently only support converting `## Section`-like format into toc. 
- doesn't support unicode characters in `##sections` (the link generated by github doesn't work anyway)

## Usage

	toc.py <md file>

then open the `<md file>` and check if you are satisfied with the generated toc 

## License

MIT license

## Showcase

**ghtoc** is so simple that itselves readme file won't contain much information. I just put here some example to let the toc in this page have some stuffs. Also it shows how the toc generated by **ghtoc** look like.

### I am happy to be the Section 1
#### Section 1 is my boss
##### Hey, the guy above, you are my boss!
###### I am not boss at all,shame!
### I stand on Section2 and I am empty
#### No you are not, In my subSection, you find characters
##### Here I test: `"([<&>]) and *$#+"`
### OK, that's it
